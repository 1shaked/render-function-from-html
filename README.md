# render-function-from-html
This repo will allow you to convert regular html to render function which you have in all frontend frameworks like Vue, Nuxt, Angular, react. 
If you look at the example branch you will see an example that work currently with vue and nuxt.

## How to use

You can run it as a flask server and use the content being serve back.
Or fork it and customize it to your needs.
